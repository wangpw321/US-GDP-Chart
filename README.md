# FRED APP (react-to-aws)

An example React app bootstrapped with `create-react-app`. I am using this project is to show alternative way of deployment to AWS. Check my YouTube channel.

## How to run (development mode)

1. Create a `.env.local` file, and paste your FRED API key there.

```
API_KEY=00000000000000000000000000000000
```

You can request your api key here: https://research.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/api_key.html


2. Install dependencies and start a dev server

```
yarn install 
yarn start
```

You can open the app in your browser (http://localhost:3000/)
